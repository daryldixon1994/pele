        Pelé was born Edson Arantes do Nascimento on 23 October 1940 in Três
        Corações, Minas Gerais, the son of Fluminense footballer Dondinho (born
        João Ramos do Nascimento) and Celeste Arantes. He was the elder of two
        siblings,[7] and was named after the American inventor Thomas Edison.[8]
        His parents decided to remove the "i" and call him "Edson", but there
        was a mistake on the birth certificate, leading many documents to show
        his name as "Edison", not "Edson", as he was called.[8][9] He was
        originally nicknamed "Dico" by his family.[7][10] He received the
        nickname "Pelé" during his school days, when, it is claimed, he was
        given it because of his pronunciation of the name of his favourite
        player, local Vasco da Gama goalkeeper Bilé, which he misspoke, but the
        more he complained the more it stuck. In his autobiography, Pelé stated
        he had no idea what the name means, nor did his old friends.[7] Apart
        from the assertion that the name is derived from that of "Bilé", and
        that it is Hebrew for "miracle" (פֶּ֫לֶא), the word has no known meaning
        in Portuguese.[note 1][11]
